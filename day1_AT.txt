CI/ CD -> Continuous Integration
       -> Continuous Delivery/ Deployment 

Application -> jio cinema 

Front End  -> HTML (function) -> js -> (Styling) Css 
 Browser -> Client -> requests -> server -> fetch the data from database if data exists then http status is 200
  if data is not found then status is 404 not found.

browser understands only html/ xml , js/ json 

 http 200 -> ok (request  response) 
http 404 -> Not found 

Back End  -> python ,java ( springboot) create the API 
 API -> Application programming interface

Rest API -> Re -> representational s-> state t-> transfer 
 
Database  -> No sql, sql 

Student  ( structural query language)
id  name  course  address 
1   Atul  IT       Lucknow
2   Mudit CS       Andhra
3   Hrshit HR       -

MySQL -> insert into student values(3,"harsht","HR");

No SQL (Json)
 student {{

  "id": 1,
  "name":"Atul",
  "course":"IT",
  "address":"Lucknow"
}

develop application which will help the customer to apply for the loan in a particular bank.
   registration form -> submit
   login form 
   apply for loan -> form  -> filled up -> submit  -> function -> Api
   
backend -> 
    spring (api) 
database -> 
   MySQL ( stored)

registration form is completely done



place ->  integrating fontend + backend + database = test 
next day next task -> integrate the entire thing in first days application
Repository -> Git 
create a repo -> main ( all data ) = test 
  

CI -> 




Git -> Version control system
Requirement to develop as an application 

-> 1st day design -> specification (pre-arranged result)  
-> 2nd day design -> specification 
-> 3rd day 

Android -> v1
v2 
v3 = v1+v2
v4 = additional features  +v1
